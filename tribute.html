          <h2>Author's Appreciation</h2>
          <p>
            When I was a kid, I always wondered what was so special about boxing
            that every house in our neighborhood would watch every fight of an
            underdog Filipino fighter. It turns out, it's not about boxing
            anymore, it's about a fighter proudly representing his own country
            behind his back against the world. That is when I learned about our
            "Pambansang Kamao" Manny Pacquiao. Upon learning Manny's backstory,
            I learned that he also worked his way from the bottom to the peak of
            his career. He experienced what it is to have nothing, and the
            struggles, as well as the hardships that we need to endure to
            achieve the things we want in life.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Manny's boxing career was extraordinary, he is the only boxer who
            has 12 belts in 8 different weight divisions. Manny experts also
            argue that Manny is in the Top 5 boxers of all time. Apart from
            being one of the best boxers, Manny remained humble and helpful to
            his fellow countryman. This is one of the things that I love about
            Manny, he does not hesitate to help those people in need. He always
            give back to the Filipinos who supported him from the start. Manny
            is also a religious person, in fact, he is a world-class youth
            pastor. Not only that, but Manny also served as a Senator in the
            Philippines, he authored and co-authored many laws that benefit the
            Filipinos. With the things Manny achieved in his life, I must say
            the list will never end, this just shows how impactful and
            inspirational Manny is.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            With all the things Manny achieved in life, he remained humble and a
            good person, Hence, I decided to present this tribute page to the
            person who inspired me to work hard in life, to not forget to help
            people along the way and to trust in God's perfect plan.
